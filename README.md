# Uber Analytics - DBT Project

This is a hands-on project I did to learn dbt. 

- I created a staging model (`stg_uber`) to clean and canonicalize a Kaggle ride-hailing dataset.
- The goal was to practice dbt workflows: seeds, models, refs, and documentation.
- Only the staging layer is built for now.

Tools used:
- dbt
- Postgres
